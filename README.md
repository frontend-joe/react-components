# React Components Library

This project is a comprehensive library of reusable React components designed to streamline the development process. It includes a variety of components such as buttons, cards, modals, dropdowns, and more, all built with accessibility and performance in mind. The components are organized into categories for easy navigation and usage.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd react-components
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Before running the project, ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   If you encounter any high vulnerabilities during installation, run:
   ```bash
   npm audit fix
   npm install
   ```
   This is often due to outdated packages in the `package-lock.json`. By running `npm install`, a new `package-lock.json` will be generated with the latest versions of the dependencies.

3. **Run the development server**:
   After installing the dependencies, start the development server with:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will launch the application in your default web browser.
